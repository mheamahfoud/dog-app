# Dog Detection and Breed Recognition Flutter App

This Flutter app is designed to detect dogs in images or from a camera feed and determine their breed using customized deep learning models built with TensorFlow.

## Overview

This app leverages deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow to detect dogs in images or live camera feeds and then identifies their breed. It provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images, capture photos, and receive instant feedback about the detected dog and its breed.

## Features

- Dog detection in images or live camera feed
- Breed recognition using custom deep learning models built with TensorFlow
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Support for both image upload and live camera feed capture

## Usage

To use this app:

1. Install the app on your mobile device.
2. Open the app and grant necessary permissions for camera access.
3. Choose an option to either upload an image or capture a photo using the camera.
4. Wait for the app to process the image and detect any dogs present.
5. Once detected, the app will display the breed information of the dog, if available.

## Custom TensorFlow Model

This app uses custom deep learning models built with TensorFlow for dog detection and breed recognition. The models have been trained on a dataset of dog breeds and optimized for accuracy and performance on mobile devices.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your system
- TensorFlow framework for model training and inference
- Knowledge of Dart programming language
- Basic understanding of deep learning concepts

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Flutter dependencies using `flutter pub get`.
3. Customize and train your own deep learning models for dog detection and breed recognition using TensorFlow.
4. Integrate the custom TensorFlow models into the Flutter app.
5. Test the app on a simulator or real device to ensure proper functionality.
6. Deploy the app to the desired platform (e.g., iOS App Store, Google Play Store).
